## About

Wheel Witch is an Android companion app for [Retro Rewind](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Retro_Rewind), a custom Mario Kart Wii distribution.
It downloads and incrementally updates the pack from the RWFC server, then launches Dolphin with the pack pre-loaded.

## Download

The latest signed release APK is built automatically on every push to `master` and published as a [pre-release](https://github.com/skiletro/WheelWitch/releases/tag/ci) with auto-generated changelog. You can also install it via [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) by importing the config from the button above.

To build from source or contribute, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#build).

## Verifying your install

You can verify the APK signature with [AppVerifier](https://github.com/soupslurpr/AppVerifier).
The signing certificate is embedded in the APK and matches the values below, so an
unmodified build will always verify the same way across releases.

- **SHA-256 fingerprint:** `75:96:8A:48:2B:75:E9:F1:72:36:3E:7D:37:5F:82:C3:BA:47:9A:84:6D:26:79:AC:C1:B7:9C:2F:11:63:70:00`
- **SHA-1 fingerprint:** `68:53:04:D6:F2:36:5F:34:98:E2:FA:DE:6A:67:7B:80:B8:70:4A:C3`

The V4 signature is also distributed as `wheelwitch-<version>-<hash>.apk.idsig`
alongside the APK in the [CI release](https://github.com/skiletro/WheelWitch/releases/tag/ci)
for offline verification.

## Requirements

- Android 12+ (API 31)
- [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org) installed
- Mario Kart Wii ISO

## First Time Setup

1. Open the app and tap **Let's get started**.
2. Tap **Got it, let's go** on the beta caveats screen.
3. Install Dolphin Emulator if prompted, then tap **Check Again**.
4. Tap **Grant Access** and pick Dolphin's `org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu` folder.
5. Tap **Select ROM File** and pick your Mario Kart Wii ISO.
6. Tap **Continue** to enter the home screen.

For returning users, the gear icon opens Settings.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Parts of this codebase were written with assistance from [MiniMax M3](https://minimax.io) and [GLM-4.7](https://z.ai) as a way to get more familiar with AI tooling.
> It was especially useful for writing test cases and porting save-related logic from the original Wheel Wizard project.
> I'm always open to conversation about AI in development and I believe it would have been disingenuous to omit the fact that it was used; I see these tools as a way to help write code, not a replacement for understanding what you're building.
